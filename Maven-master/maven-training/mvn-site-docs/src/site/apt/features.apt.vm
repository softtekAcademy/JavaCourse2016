Supported Features

* Supported Permissions

  * NOTHING

    ** This is equal to the expression <<user =>>

  * READ

    ** This is equal to the expression <<user = r>>

  * READ/WRITE

    ** This is equal to the expression <<user = rw>>

  A write permission alone is not supported, cause it does not make sense
  in relationship with {{{http://subversion.apache.org}Subversion}}.

* Global Rule

  The global rule can be used like the following to define anybody with
  a particular permission. In this case anybody is represented by the <<*>>.

+----
[/]
* = r
+----

* User permission

  A permission for a particular area of the repository can be defined for a special
  user like the following:

+----
[calc:/path/to/]
username_a = rw
username_b = r
+----

  Based on the above example the <<<username_a>>> has <read/write> permission to the
  path <</path/to>> in the repository <<calc>> whereas the <<<username_b>>> has only
  <read> permission


* Aliases

  The alias is a way to define a complicate user name which
  can be used to simplify the maintenance of the access file.

+----
[aliases]
harry = CN=Harold Hacker,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com
sally = CN=Sally Swatterbug,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com
joe = CN=Gerald I. Joseph,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com

[groups]
calc-developers = &harry, &sally, &joe
paint-developers = &frank, &sally, &jane
everyone = @calc-developers, @paint-developers
+----


* Groups

  In {{{http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn-book.html#svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz}Subversion authentication file}}
  as well as in SAPM you can define a Group which contains users, groups and
  alias as well. This means it's possible to define a Group of Groups like in
  the following example:

+----
[groups]
project-a = harry, brian
project-b = michael, sally
project-c = jonas
all-developer = @project-a, @project-b, @project-c
+----

  The defined groups can be used to grant permission to the repository and/or paths instead
  of particular users.

+----
[repo1:/project-a/]
@project-a = rw
[repo1:/project-b/]
@project-b = rw
[repo1:/project-c/]
@project-c = rw
+----


* Tokens

  There existing two special tokens <<<$authenticated>>> and <<<$anonymous>>> which
  represent an authenticated user (has a username) or a unauthorized user (no user name).

* Exclusion Marker

  The exclusion marker <<<~>>> is used to invert the meaning of a permission rule.

+----
[groups]
calc-developers = harry, sally, joe
calc-owners = hewlett, packard
calc = @calc-developers, @calc-owners

# Any calc participant has read-write access...
[calc:/projects/calc]
@calc = rw

# ...but only allow the owners to make and modify release tags.
[calc:/projects/calc/tags]
~@calc-owners = r
+----

  This means that all users who don't match the rule <<<@calc-owner>>> will get <read> permission
  for this area.

  The above configuration file can be expressed by the following code for permissions definition:

+----
AccessRules accessRules = new AccessRules();

User userHarry = UserFactory.createInstance("harry");
User userSally = UserFactory.createInstance("sally");
User userJoe = UserFactory.createInstance("joe");
User userHewlett = UserFactory.createInstance("hewlett");
User userPackard = UserFactory.createInstance("packard");


Group calcDevelopers = new Group("calc-developers");
// @calc-developers = harry, sally, joe
calcDevelopers.add(userHarry);
calcDevelopers.add(userSally);
calcDevelopers.add(userJoe);

Group calcOwners = new Group("calc-owners");
// @calc-owners = hewlett, packard
calcOwners.add(userHewlett);
calcOwners.add(userPackard);

// calc = @calc-developers, @calc-owners
Group calc = new Group("calc");
calc.add(calcDevelopers);
calc.add(calcOwners);

// [calc:/projects/calc]
// @calc = rw
AccessRule ar_1 = new AccessRule("calc", "/projects/calc/");
ar_1.add(calc, AccessLevel.READ_WRITE);

// [calc:/projects/calc/tags]
// ~@calc-owners = r
AccessRule ar_2 = new AccessRule("calc", "/projects/calc/tags/");
ar_2.addNegative(calcOwners, AccessLevel.READ);

accessRules.add(ar_1);
accessRules.add(ar_2);
+----

* Order of rules

  Based on the following rule set the user <jenny>
  will get a READ permission to the repository <<calc>>
  in the folder <</project/>>.

+----
[groups]
groupa = jenny, joe, danny
[calc:/project/]
@groupa = rw
jenny = r
+----

  But if we just change the order of the last rule like this:

+----
[groups]
groupa = jenny, joe, danny
[calc:/project/]
jenny = r
@groupa = rw
+----

  The user <jenny> will get a READ/WRITE permission based on the
  membership to the group <<groupa>> instead of READ as before.

  This means the order of the rules counts.
