Load Authentication file

* First simple example

  Usually you have an existing authentication file which
  you like to use for your Java application.

+----
AuthorizationFile authorizationFile
try {
    authorizationFile = new AuthorizationFile();
    authorizationFile.load(new File("/path/to/svnaccess.conf"));
} catch (AuthorizationFileException e) {
    System.out.println("Something has gone wrong: " + e.getMessage());
}

AccessLevel al_user = authorizationFile.getAccessRules().getAccess(user, repository, accessPath);
