  <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong>
  </div>
  <div>
  <p>
  This example will print two notes that were defined by the "FirstController" controller as properties (variables) in the scope.<br>
  
  Important thing to notice: <br>
  1. A FirstController instance is instantiated as "understandScope" using the ng-controller angular directive.  This ng-controller directive creates a new scope;<br>
  2. The first note is printed by invoking the getFirstNote() function defined within the FirstController controller;  <br>
  3. The second note is printed by means of using an expression that retrieves the value of the note from the scope.
  </p>
  </div>
  <hr>


  <div ng-controller="FirstController as understandScope">
  <!--Print first note.	-->
  <p>{{understandScope.getFirstNote()}}</p>

  <!--Print second note.	-->
  <p>{{note2}}</p>
  
</div>
