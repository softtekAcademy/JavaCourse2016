  <p>You need to make sure the "EXAM RESULTS" section relfects automatically the responses from the "EXAM QUESTIONS" section in real time.  
  Basically, you need to implement 2-way binding between the HTML controls in the "EXAM QUESTION" section and the "EXAM RESULT" section that read the model.

   <p>What is 2-way binding?</p> 
  <br>
   <input ng-model="binding.question1" type="radio" value="10" /> The automated synchronization of data between the MODEL and the VIEW.  If MODEL changes, VIEW changes.  If VIEW changes, MODEL changes.
  <br>
  <input ng-model="binding.question1" type="radio" value="0" /> The automated synchronization of data between the MODEL and the VIEW.  If MODEL changes, VIEW does not change.  If VIEW changes, MODEL changes.

  <br>
   <p>What is an expression?</p> 
  <br>
  <input ng-model="binding.question2" type="radio" value="10" /> Angular specific constructs that access model variables and functions and that are evaluated within double curly braces {{}}
  <br>
  <input ng-model="binding.question2" type="radio" value="0" /> HTML specific constructs that compute data

  <br>
   <p>What is ng-model?</p> 
  <br>
  <input ng-model="binding.question3" type="radio" value="10" /> Angular specific directive that associates an HTML control with a specific property in the model to implement 2-way binding between the HTML control and the model property.
  <br>
  <input ng-model="binding.question3" type="radio" value="0" /> HTML attribute for declaring an HTML element as a function in the controller.

  <br>
   <p>What is ng-bind?</p> 
  <br>
  <input ng-model="binding.question4" type="radio" value="10" /> An angular specific directive that is equivalent of an expression in curly braces.  It will read a property from the model and will place it in the view.
  <br>
  <input ng-model="binding.question4" type="radio" value="0" /> Angular specific directive that associates an HTML control with a specific property in the model to implement 2-way binding between the HTML control and the model property.
